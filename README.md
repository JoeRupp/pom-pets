# Pom Pets ‚è∞

## Overview:

Pom Pets is a pomodoro/time management mobile application themed around taking care of a pet. This application is a group project completed during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design that was completed over the duration of one week. The main goal of this project was to self teach a new technology to ourselves and use it. In this case, it was React Native.

A Pom Pet is a way to help measure your poms and productivity while working. By taking the [Pomodoro concept](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) and "gamifying" it by borrowing themes from games like [Tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi), Pom Pets creates a way to visually represent your work/break time as a Pet. The stricter you are with your work and break schedule, the healthier the pet. If your work and break time are too disproportionate, your Pet's health will decrease.

## Goals:

- Teach ourselves React Native and build a basic app in about a week.
- Introduce ourselves to TypeScript and its syntax.
- Learn how to coordinate with the backend to make a JSON contract, as well as coordinate with a designer.

## Technologies:

- React Native
- Typescript
- Javascript
- React Navigation
- Expo
- Xcode
- Firebase
- Restful APIs
- Adobe XD
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Photoshop

## Future Additions:

- Add more Pom Pet options, and build in animations for each pet.
- Complete build out sign up and login functionality.
- Collaborate with backend to create more end points allowing the user to delete projects.
- Create a more robust stastics screen to view and interact with.
