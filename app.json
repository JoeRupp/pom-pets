By taking the Pomodoro concept]and 'gamifying' it by borrowing themes from games like Tamagotchi, Pom Pets creates a way to visually represent your work/break time as a Pet. The stricter you are with your work and break schedule, the healthier the pet. If your work and break time are too disproportionate, your Pet's health will decrease.",
